# Classifying-Hand-Signs

We will be working on a very cool problem which is classifying hand signs. In each image the hand is holding certain number of fingers up. The number of fingers held by the hand is the class number. The original dataset is in a format call h5 format. It is an efficient format to store and organize large amounts of data. [Click here to read more about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format). The following function `load_dataset()` is ready for you to use. It will return four variables in the following order: X_train, Y_train, X_test, Y_test. Hence, your data is already splitted and there is no need for you to split it.
